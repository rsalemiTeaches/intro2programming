    "This notebook and the ones that follow introduce you to the world of programming.  You may be taking a class that uses MicroPython, C++, or MATLAB, but you'll see that the basic concepts of programming are the same across all the languages.\n",

    "\n",
    "If you've cooked from a recipe, built a Lego model using the instructions, or followed directions to a room, you have experienced the basics of programming.  In each activity, you read instructions step-by-step and followed them to achieve a goal.  \n",
    "\n",
    "All computers, from the handheld computer in your phone to the giant computers that manage the world's financial transactions, work the same way.  They all read instructions and follow them step-by-step to achieve a goal. When you write a program, you tell the computer exactly what to do, and it does it.\n",

    "# Your first program: Hello, World\n",
    "It is an ancient programming tradition that all new programmers introduce themselves to the programming world by running a program named *Hello, world.*  Here is that program in Python, the language we'll use to learn about programming."
