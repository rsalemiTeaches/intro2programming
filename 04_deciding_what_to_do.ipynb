    "## Writing IF/ELIF/ELSE blocks in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "The example above shows the basics of writing an `if/elif/else` block in Python. You need to notice some details in the code to be able to write your own block.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The block starts with the word `if`.  Then you put in a statement like `US_score > Argentine_score` that returns a `True` or `False` value.  We'll see later that you could also use a function that returns `True` or `False` in an `if` statement.  \n",
    "\n",
    "* You put a colon (`:`) at the end of the `if` to tell Python that the statement is complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Very important** You indent the next line to tell Python which instructions to run if the statement is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Very important** You outdent the `elif` statement to tell Python that the block of instructions is complete and it needs to check another value.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The `elif` means \"else if\" as in \"If the US wins print this, else if Argentina wins print that.\"  You can string many `elif` statements together to check many values.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The `elif` looks like an `if` because it also has a conditional. This is `(Argentine_score > US_score)` in this case.  Again, you finish with a colon.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Very important** You indent the statements that run if the `elif` condition is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Very important** You outdent the `else` statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The `else` statement runs if all the conditions are false.  In this case it only runs if the US score is not greater than the Argentine score *and* the Argentine score is not greater than the US score.\n",
    "\n",
    "* You end the `else` with another colon.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Very important** Indent the statements that run if you reach the `else` statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "### There can be only one\n",
    "\n",
    "When you create an `if/elif/else` block, remember that only one of the conditions will run.  If the first condition is true, then the `elif` statements don't run.  If any of the `elif` statements are true, then the `elif` statements after the true statement do not run, and the `else` does not run.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Other Languages\n",
    "\n",
    "The example here works with Python.  Other languages, such as C++ and MATLAB, also have if/elif/else structures with different names.  They also have different ways of showing the commands to run on a true statement. \n",
