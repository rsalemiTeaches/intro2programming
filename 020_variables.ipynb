    "We started by comparing programming to creating step-by-step instructions for a computer. We then discussed building a Lego project from instructions as an example of real-life programming. However, the instructions for Legos are simple because they always build the same car.  What if you wanted to create more complicated instructions, such as keeping score in a baseball game?\n",
    "\n",
    "You want instructions that say, give each team 0 points at the beginning of the game and add points to their scores at the end of each inning.  This is a more complicated problem than building a car from Legos because the score can be almost any number. Also, you need to store numbers in two places, one for the home team and one for the visitors. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Variables* allow us to store data using a name (such as `home_score` or `visitor_score` and use the data later in the program, like when we're adding runs to each score.\n",

    "## A simple start: a name\n",
