    "# Adding New Functions: Importing Modules\n",

    "\n",

    "`from random import randint`\n",
    "\n",
    "What does this line actually do? It **imports** a new ability into our program from an external \"toolbox.\" In programming, these toolboxes are called **modules** or **libraries**.\n",
