    "# Essential Cleanup: `try` and `finally`\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you've written a program that opens a file to save some data. Your program is like a person who takes something out of a drawer. But what happens if the program gets interrupted or hits an error before it can \"put the file back\"?\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Problem:** You've left a resource open. An open file can sometimes get locked or corrupted. This is like leaving a mess behind you. How can we make sure our program *always* cleans up after itself, even when things go wrong?\n",
    "\n",
    "That's where a powerful Python tool comes in: the **`try...finally`** block. It's designed to guarantee that your cleanup code always runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The \"Workshop Cleanup\" Analogy\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of your code like working in a woodshop.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The **`try`** block is your main work session. It's where you do all the fun stuff: cutting wood, drilling holes, and building your project.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The **`finally`** block is the unbreakable workshop rule: **\"No matter what happens, you MUST sweep the floor and turn off all the power tools before you leave.\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "This final step is the **cleanup**. It doesn't matter if you finish perfectly or get interrupted halfway through. The cleanup rule *always* happens at the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our code:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `try`: This is where we put our main actions that might leave a mess (like opening a file).\n",
    "\n",
    "* `finally`: This is where we put our essential cleanup code (like closing the file). It's guaranteed to run.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A Simple Example: Cleaning Up a File\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at some code. This program will open a file and write a message to it. The most important part is that it *always* closes the file when it's done.\n"

For any program that uses important resources—like files, network connections, or databases—this isn't just a good idea, it's essential for writing reliable code that always cleans up after itself.\n"
